Erlang simple string
====================

A wrapper library that attempts to make Erlang's string functions in the string, lists, erlang, and (eventually) re modules seem coherent to beginners.

The initial version is purely a wrapper for traditional list-based strings.  Future versions may:

* rename some functions to make them more familiar to developers coming from other languages
* fill some gaps for string functionality
* add support for binary strings across the set

The library is under the (2-clause) Simplified BSD license.

To generate documentation just lauch `edoc:files(["sstr.erl"], [{dir, "doc"}]).` by Elang shell.
